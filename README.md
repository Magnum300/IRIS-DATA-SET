# IRIS-DATASET-ANALYSIS- CLASSIFICATION
# Dataset Information
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
# Attribute Information:-
* sepal length in cm
* sepal width in cm
* petal length in cm
* petal width in cm
* species: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica

# Libraries
* pandas -provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. supports operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.
* matplotlib -plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc.
* seaborn -used to ease the challenging task of data visualization
* scikit-learn -supports variously supervised and unsupervised algorithms like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc
* Numpy- for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object.
# Algorithms
* Logistic Regression - used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary (dichotomous ) variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
* K-Nearest Neighbors -uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
* Decision Tree -non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
